  This project is a training to multi-threads/multi-process programming with the use of mutex and semaphore.
It contains 3 different programs simulating a twist of the famous Dining Philosophers problem, all with the same basic rules.
This project is also a good lesson in C optimization as we need to save every bit of CPU usage we can to ensure the survival of our philosophers.
